Verilog Hardware Description Language Project

This repository consists of projects I have worked on using Verilog HDL during my time at the University of Toronto.
The projects in this repository are based on the following courses:

• ECE 241 F – Digital Systems (Fall 2023), Language: Verilog HDL

Currently this repository contains only my final project for ECE 241.
